# Fine-Tuning GPT-2 Model for Custom Text Generation

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the GPT-2 model using both **zero-shot** and **few-shot** approaches. The fine-tuned model can generate text based on specific prompts or datasets. The project includes training, inference, and saving the model for future use.

## Introduction

This project fine-tunes the GPT-2 model using a custom dataset (e.g., text extracted from a PDF file). The process includes:

1. **Zero-Shot Fine-Tuning**: Using the pre-trained GPT-2 model without additional training.
2. **Few-Shot Fine-Tuning**: Training the model on a small dataset to adapt it to a specific domain.
3. **Inference**: Generating text using the fine-tuned model.
